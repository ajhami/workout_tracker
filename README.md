## Description
This project is designed to help implement a full backend using MongoDB and Node.js. The frontend design navigates users to save workout information from each day then view a summary of their exercise.

- Usage
- Note to user

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine, then run this installation through the terminal:

```git
npm install
```

You can also add seed data by running the following in the terminal:
```git
npm run seed
```

### Usage
Upon startup, a summary of the most recent workout will appear (if applicable). The user can then update the workout or add a new one. After filling out new information, they can add more workout and view exercise history.

### Note to User
This application was deployed on June 29th and has no seed data uploaded to the heroku application. I will continue to add entries over the course of the next week to stretch out workout entries, thus demonstrating the detail of the [stats page](http://murmuring-cove-62119.herokuapp.com/stats).
